Project Title: Movie Recommender System

Project Description:
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system using soft computing 
techniques, specifically artificial intelligence and machine learning. The system analyzes 
user data and movie attributes to generate tailored recommendations that align with 
individual tastes.

Key Features :
• Collaborative filtering 
• Content based filtering
• Machine Learning Algorithms
• Context Awareness

Prerequisites:
• Azure Subscription:
• Make sure you have an active Azure subscription.
• Azure Virtual Machine:
• Ensure that you have a virtual machine (VM) or another resource for 
which you want to monitor CPU usage.

Setup:
• Dependencies:
Ensure required libraries and frameworks are installed.
 Include translation API keys for language support.
 
• Configuration:
Adjust system parameters, collaborative filtering weights, and translation settings 
in the configuration file.

• Training:
Train machine learning models using historical data for optimal performance.
 Set up translation model if applicable
Azure Services Used:

• Azure Core Services
1. Azure Virtual Machine:
 Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are on-demand, scalable computing 
resources provided by Microsoft Azure. They enable you to run virtualized 
Windows or Linux servers in the cloud. Here are some key points about Azure 
Virtual Machines

2. Azure Monitor CPU Alert:
Creating a CPU usage alert in Azure Monitor involves several steps. Azure Monitor 
allows you to set up alerts based on various metrics, including CPU usage. Below is a 
general guide on how to create a CPU usage alert using Azure Monitor:

• Azure AI Service

Azure AI Translator Service :
The core of the translation functionality is powered by Azure AI Translator service. This 
service employs advanced natural language processing algorithms to provide accurate 
and contextually relevant translations across a wide array of languages.
