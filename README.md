## Problem Statement: 
In our increasingly more interconnected global, the need for seamless verbal exchange throughout language boundaries is extra important than ever. Users face difficulties exploring movies due to language barriers, limiting their ability to discover content in languages other than their native tongue. The assignment lies in offering a consumer-friendly platform wherein people can without difficulty translate content while maintaining a report in their interactions. The possibility is to create an green, scalable solution that addresses language translation desires and complements consumer revel in with the aid of incorporating recent search records. 

## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system using soft computing 
techniques, specifically artificial intelligence and machine learning. The system analyzes 
user data and movie attributes to generate tailored recommendations that align with 
individual tastes. This system leverages the power of Azure AI Translator Services to not only provide personalized movie recommendations but also facilitate seamless cross-language interactions for a truly global audience. It aims to create an immersive and user-friendly platform that transcends language barriers. By seamlessly integrating language translation and personalized recommendations, this app aims to bring users closer to a diverse world of cinema, transcending linguistic boundaries and fostering a global community of movie enthusiasts.


## Key Features :
- Multilingual User Interface
- Real-Time Language Translation
- Cross-Language Social Integration
- Adaptive Learning Mechanism
- Dynamic Content Updates

## Prerequisites:
- Azure Subscription: Make sure you have an active Azure subscription.
- Azure Virtual Machine: Ensure that you have a virtual machine (VM) or another resource for 
which you want to monitor CPU usage.
- Azure Ai Translator Service: Ensure that you have translator service key, region and endpoint to translate the web content.

## Setup:
- Dependencies: Ensure required libraries and frameworks are installed. Include translation API keys for language support.
- Configuration: Adjust system parameters, collaborative filtering weights, and translation settings in the configuration file.
- Training: Train machine learning models using historical data for optimal performance. Set up translation model if applicable

## Azure Services Used:

### Azure Core Services

### 1. Azure Virtual Machine:
 
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are on-demand, scalable computing 
resources provided by Microsoft Azure. They enable you to run virtualized 
Windows or Linux servers in the cloud. Here are some key points about Azure 
Virtual Machines

### 2. Azure Monitor CPU Alert:

Creating a CPU usage alert in Azure Monitor involves several steps. Azure Monitor 
allows you to set up alerts based on various metrics, including CPU usage. Below is a 
general guide on how to create a CPU usage alert using Azure Monitor:

### Azure AI Service

### Azure AI Translator Service :
The core of the translation functionality is powered by Azure AI Translator service. This 
service employs advanced natural language processing algorithms to provide accurate 
and contextually relevant translations across a wide array of languages. Azure AI Translator Service is the engine behind the Movie Recommender System app language translation capabilities. It employs advanced natural language processing to deliver accurate and contextually relevant translations.
